# Node/Express Server

In this project, I am going to start by building backend authentication services followed but other services to build a posting app, like "Letgo", people will come and list a product and other users will be able to look at existing products, sell their own products, and write reviews on products they see. I will be wiring it up to a firebase initially but will most likely eventually move to a postgresql database with more time.
